# a simple interactive guide program with Dijkstra

During the process of Dijkstra, we can't get the minimal distance in a little instructions while deleting a vertex or an edge.

So, we must rerun the Dijsktra to get the updated minimal distance.

The process of Floyed is just so compared to Dijkstra. Thanks to yjm :)
